        <h1>Learning Management System (LMS)</h1>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Learning Management System (LMS) is a web-based platform designed to enhance the learning experience for students, provide faculty members with tools to manage educational content, and allow administrators to oversee system operations efficiently.</p>

        <h2>Software Development Stages</h2>
        <p>We followed the core software engineering phases to ensure a robust and efficient system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Requirements Specification:</strong> Defined functional and non-functional requirements, including user roles (Admin, Faculty, Students), system features, and performance constraints (e.g., system initialization within 2 seconds).</li>
            <li><strong>Design with UML Diagrams:</strong> Created UML diagrams to model the relationships between actors (Students, Faculty, Admins) and system functionalities like course management and evaluations.</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Developed the system using a modular architecture with separate Admin, Faculty, and Student modules, ensuring scalability and maintainability.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Conducted rigorous testing, including test cases for user account creation, login validation, and course management to ensure the system meets all requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Core System Functionalities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Admins can manage users, courses, evaluations, and generate reports.</li>
            <li>Faculty members can upload course content, track student progress, and view feedback.</li>
            <li>Students can register for courses, take exams, view scores, and provide feedback.</li>
            <li>Features include a course calendar, notifications, assessment engine, and teaching performance evaluation module.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML:</strong> For structuring the web-based interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong> For responsive and modern UI design.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to secure user access.</li>
            <li><strong>MVC Architecture:</strong> Used to separate concerns, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.</li>
        </ul>
